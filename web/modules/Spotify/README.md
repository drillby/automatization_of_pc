### Spotify:

- You need to set up tekore.cfg. See https://tekore.readthedocs.io/en/stable/getting_started.html, and put it in the web/web folder. For that use <br>

```python
from modules.Spotify.Spotify_auth import create_credentials

create_credentials()
```

- Also you need to set up developer account for Spotify. See https://developer.spotify.com
- Some functions may require Spotify premium account
- All of the functions are described in the web/modules/Spotify folder in each file
