# README Automatization of PC
Author: Pavel Podrazký

This project contains some ideas how to automate my work on PC.

## IDEAS:
* Shell script that will run local server for Spotify and will open wanted web page
* Shell script that will take param and return google search results with given params
* Dynamicly change text on web page based on volume
* Dynamicly change text on web page based on currently playing device - done
* Dynamicly change album picture on web page based on currently playinng track - done
* Dynamicly write LAN reproductors on web page - done

## ISSUES:
* Changing name of track and cover image is ONLY working for songs (not albums, artists and playlists)
