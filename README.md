# README Automatization of PC
Author: Pavel Podrazký

This project contains some ideas how to automate my work on PC.

## IDEAS:
* Shell script that will run local server for Spotify and will open wanted web page
* Shell script that will take param and return google search results with given params
* Dynamicly change text on web page based on volume

## ISSUES:
* Changing name of track and cover image is ONLY working for songs (not albums, artists and playlists)
